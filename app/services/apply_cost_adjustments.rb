# Apply a series of {CostAdjustment cost adjustments} to one or more costs.
#
# The adjustments are applied in this order:
#
#   1. The percent-based adjustments are summed and subtracted from the given
#      cost. ex: $100 - ($100 * (5% + 10% + 10%)) = $75
#   2. The price-based adjustments are then summed and subtracted from that
#      result. ex: $75 - ($10 + $5) = $60
