  # If the housing facility for this individual assignment is an apartment,
  # look for the "DO NO CHARGE FOR THIS ASSIGNMENT" flag - if YES, the charge =
  # $0, and quit.
  #
  # For ALL dorm housing assignments (in case there's more than one), add up
  # the TOTAL number of days living in a DORM (only). Call this the TOTAL Dorm
  # Days.
  #
  # For each individual adult housing assignment:
  #   1) Calculate length of stay in # days for this individual assignment:
  #      arrival date minus departure date (result must be greater than 0)
  #
  #   2) Using Housing Facility from the assignment, determine the Cost Code.
  #
  #   3) If the housing facility is an APARTMENT, check to see if "WAIVE
  #      MINIMUM STAY" is checked. If so, go to step 4. If MINIMUM STAY for
  #      this housing facility is > length of stay, length of stay = MINIMUM
  #      STAY
  #
  #   4) Using the Cost Code, look up Adult $?/Day daily cost. A cost code may
  #      have multiple cost "groups". The correct cost group will be determined
  #      by choosing the group where the smallest Maximum Stay is >= either
  #      (the apartment individual length of stay) or (the TOTAL Dorm Days).
  #
  #   5) If the housing facility for this individual assignment is a DORM, if
  #      the "Single Occupancy" is YES, look up the "SINGLE UPCHARGE $/DAY" for
  #      this length of stay (for an apartment type, the "SINGLE UPCHARGE
  #      $/DAY" will always be $0).
  #
  #   6) Total cost is: individual length of stay X (daily cost + daily
  #      upcharge)
  #
  #   7) If the housing facility for this individual assignment is an
  #      apartment, multiply the total cost by the %COST THE OCCUPANT MUST PAY
  #
  # The final output is the resulting dollar amount.
