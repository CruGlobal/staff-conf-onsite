  # First, for ALL dorm housing assignments (in case there's more than one),
  # add up the TOTAL number of days living in a dorm. Call this the TOTAL Days.
  #
  # For each individual child dorm housing assignment:
  #
  # 1) Calculate length of say in # days for this individual assignment:
  #    arrival date minus departure date (result must be greater than 0).
  #
  # 2) Using dorm, look up daily cost in cost code table for the TOTAL Days
  #    length of stay using the following age breakdown:
  #    Use "ADULT $/DAY" column if child's age is >=15 years old
  #    Use "TEEN $/DAY" column if child's age is >=11 <15 years old
  #    Use "CHILD $/DAY" column if (child's age is >= 5 < 11 years old AND "Needs Bed" = YES)
  #    Use "INFANT $/DAY" column if (child's age is <5 years old AND "Needs Bed" = YES)
  #    Use "CHILD MEAL ONLY $/DAY" if (child'd age is <11 and "Needs Bed" = NO)
  #
  # 3) If the "Single Occupancy" is YES, look up the "SINGLE UPCHARGE $/DAY"
  #    for this length of stay
  #
  # 4) Total cost is: individual length of stay multiplied by (daily cost +
  #    daily upcharge)
  #
  # 5) Loop through if there are multiple child dorm assignments
