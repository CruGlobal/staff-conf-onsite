# This service accepts an uploaded spreadsheet file and converts it into a
# "ruby-representation" of that spreadsheet, which can then be processed by
# other services.
#
# == Spreadsheet file
#
# This service can accept four types of spreadsheets:
#
#  1. OpenOffice (.ods)
#  2. Comma-separated text file (.csv)
#  3. Old Microsoft Excel (.xls)
#  4. New Microsoft Excel (.xlsx)
#
# == Spreadsheet "Ruby Representation"
#
# Abstractly, a "spreadsheet" is a 3D array of strings. A single sheet in a
# spreadsheet is a 2D array of columns and rows of strings, and a spreadsheet
# may have multiple sheets.
#
# This service expects this spreadsheet to be an +Enumerable+ of "sheets",
# where each sheet is an +Enumerable+ or "rows," where each row is an
# +Enumerable+ of "cells" in that row, and each cell is a +String+.

  # Convert the uploaded file into a list of rows, each of which is a list of

  # Because the uploaded file is certainly a Tempfile, we unlink it afterwards.
