# Provides the status of an upload job running in the background, so that we
# can update the user-agent with its progress.
#
# It's possible that an uploaded file will have to be uploaded in multple
# steps, so an upload's job has multiple "stages", each of which will move its
# "percentage" from 0.0 to 1.0. So it is possible for {#percentage} to be +1.0+
# without the job being {#finished}
