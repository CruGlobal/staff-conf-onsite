        For a large import, please be patient as this process may take a long
        time.

        The first row must contain column header names. We use the headers to
        determine which rows map to which record attributes. They can appear in
        any order however. The column headers are listed in the following
        table. Each column is required, but only a few columns must have values
        for every row. Other columns may be blank.
