# The superclass for all Security +Policy+ subclasses in the system. For each
# {ApplicationRecord model type}, there is a Policy class with a matching name
# that determines whether a given user can access it.
#
# +Policy+ subclasses can control whether an arbitrary {User} can *Create*,
# *Read*, *Update*, or *Destroy* records of a single type.
#
# @attr_reader user [User] The user requesting access to the given record.
# @attr_reader record [ApplicationRecord] The model object the user wants to
#   access.
